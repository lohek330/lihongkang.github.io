# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher of [Department of Electrical and System Engineering]([https://ideas.seas.upenn.edu/](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/)) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Rene Vidal](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/rene-vidal/). Previously, I received my PhD degree from the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering](https://ecse.rpi.edu/about) of [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) in 2024. My advisor is Prof. [Meng Wang](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019. Here is my [CV](../lihongkang.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).

My research area is machine learning and deep learning theory. My research interests include
+ Generalization and optimization theory of Transformer-based foundation models.
+ Theoretical parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
+ Graph neural network and its theory.
